# David's stylesheets

My custom stylesheets for various web sites, intended to be used with [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

To install a stylesheet, open it's GitHub page and click the _Raw_ button. Stylus should detect it and allow you to install it.

These stylesheets are for my own personal usage and I will not offer any kind of support for them.
